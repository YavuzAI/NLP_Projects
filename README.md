# NLP Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of language understanding and generation. Each project demonstrates different NLP techniques, methodologies, and datasets, showcasing my skills in text analysis and machine learning.

## Purpose
The primary intention of this repository is to:
- Provide an understanding of NLP techniques and applications.
- Highlight the use of various algorithms for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis.
- Share insights and methodologies that can be beneficial for learning and reference in NLP scenarios.
- Receive feedback from others to enhance my understanding of NLP projects.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews + Text Classification]
**Description**: A project analyzing movie reviews to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in the text.

**Techniques Used**:
- **Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal
- **Visualization**: Pie charts for Sentiment Analysis


## Conclusion
Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of Natural Language Processing techniques and their applications. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about NLP methodologies, their practical implementations, and how they can be leveraged to extract insights from textual data.# NLP_Projects
